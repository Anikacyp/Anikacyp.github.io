#About Me
I am a master student of Computer Science, In my master period, I mainly study the **Influence Maximization** problem on Social Network. 

Besides, I am also interested in *Data Mining* and *Machine Learning*, I am also learning the *statistics* and *probability theory*.  I hope you can communicate with me if you have any problems when you read my blogs.

Except the 'IT' stuff, I am also have strong interests in **Languages**, the language here is not the C++, Java or Python, its the real language, i like kinds of language and i have kept stuying *Spanish*  for months, at present i can speak **Mandarin**, **English** and **Spanish**, I hope we can change experiences on this part if you are interested in languages too.

I will keep updating my blogs and self-introduction, that's it, THANKS FOR YOUR WATCHING!

I read a book named "Nonviolent Communication - A language of Life", it made me think a lot and know something. When i finished the book, i will write down something worthy, now a valueble poet for you.

>I feel so sentenced by your words,

>I feel so judged and sent away,

>Before i go i'v got to know,

>Is that what you mean to say?

>Before i raise to my defense,

>Before i speak in hurt or fear,

>Before i build that wall of words, 

>Tell me, did i realy hear?

>Words are windows, or they're walls,

>They sentence us, or set us free, 

>When i speak and when i hear,

>Let the love light shine through me, 

>There are things i need to say,

>Things that mean so much to me, 

>If my words don't make me clear,

>Will you help me to be free?

>If i seemed to put you down,

>If you felt i didn't care,

>Try to listen through my words, 

>To the feelings that we share.
